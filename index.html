    <p><i>... minimalist form validation with powerful results</i></p>


<p>
Validating forms has notoriously been a painful development
experience. Implementing client side validation in a user friendly way
is a tedious and arduous process • you want to validate fields only at
the appropriate time (when the user has had the chance to enter the
data) • you want to present validation errors in a pleasing way • you
may need to apply custom validation (specific to your application
domain) • etc.
</p>

<p>
Even with the introduction of HTML5's Form Validation, it is still
overly complex, and doesn't address many common scenarios (mentioned
above). Without the proper approach, form validation can be one of the
most difficult tasks in web development.

      This is currently work-in-progress and will be used to
      cross-communicate to co-workers on the project.
